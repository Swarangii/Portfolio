<h1>🌐 Personal Portfolio – Custom Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h1>
<p>Welcome to my custom-built personal portfolio! This project is developed using core web technologies — HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript — to demonstrate creativity, functionality, and responsiveness in a user-friendly layout.</p>

<h3>✨ Features</h3>
<h5>🌙 Day / Night Mode</h5>
<p>Easily switch between light and dark themes with a smooth toggle. The UI adapts for comfortable viewing in both bright and low-light environments.</p>

<h5>🔗 Usable Links & Hyperlinks</h5>
<p>The site includes functional hyperlinks to:

<ul>Social media accounts
</ul>
<ul>GitHub profile</ul>
<ul>Contact section</ul>
<ul>Resume/downloadable resources</ul>

All links are carefully validated and styled for accessibility and ease of use.

📍 Real-Time Navigation via Location Hyperlink
A dynamic hyperlink is integrated to direct users to my current or preferred location using Google Maps. This enhances trust and professionalism, especially for clients and recruiters.
